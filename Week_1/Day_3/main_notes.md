### Summary
1. [Review primitive types](#primitive-types)
2. [Objects](#objects)
3. [Passing primitives and objects to functions](#passing-primitives-and-objects-to-functions)
4. [Functions inside objects (using `this`)](#functions-inside-objects)
5. [Object iteration with `for...in`](#object-iteration-forin)

### Primitive Types
"Literal" is a text representation of the value in your code.

### Objects

### Passing Primitives and Objects to Functions
> Primitives are passed by value,
>
> Objects are passed by reference.

### Functions Inside Objects
A method is a function defined within an object.

### Object Iteration (`for...in`)
