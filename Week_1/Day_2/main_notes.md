### Approach to Lectures

Lectures are what you make the most of.

**Zoom:**
- Instructor will provide a Zoom link in your Discord channels 15-20 mins before lecture.
- Lecture starts at 10:00PT, scheduled for 2 hours (sometimes goes over)
- 10-min break around 11:30PT
- Camera should be on to make it more engaging

**Lecture**
- Mix of theory and practice (mostly practice)
- Provide context and explain why
- Code demonstration (similar to pair coding)
- If you have questions, raise your hand or put it in the chat.

**Post-lecture**
- Don't expect to understand 100% of the content right off the bat
- Repetition helps. Revisit the lecture, go back and look at the code.
- Ask plenty of questions!

**What lectures are NOT**
- A coding-along session
- Time to do your daily activities
- A chill environment (it's intense, especially in the first few weeks)

### Tools

**Shortcuts**
- VSCode has a ton of helpful shortcuts that will make your environment easier to navigate. There is a cheatsheet for each OS.

**ESLint**
- Very helpful, it will make it much easier.

**Google**
- You will use it every single day.

### Version Control - GIT

Why git?
- Repositories
- Saves milestones
- Keeps a history of your code
- Backup copy of your project on github
- Work better as teams, branches (no overstepping others' code)
- This is the best time to learn how to use it and become comfortable with git.

GIT Workflow
- `git init`
- `git status`
- `git add .` or `git add [filename]`
- `git commit -m "message"`
- `git remote -v (or add origin, rm origin)`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git log`
